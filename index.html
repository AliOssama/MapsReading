    <p> The first mistake is trying to fit the globe on a flat picture of a map. As mentioned in the book, there is no perfect solution for
    this problem, there will be missing information. In the image above, we can see how this map is so complex that it started to lose 
    shape and areas. </p>

    <p> The second problem is using what is called the Meracator projection, which was created for see navigation, for world map. This is
    shown in the image above at which is represents the world but the landmass area rations are in fact way off. </p>
